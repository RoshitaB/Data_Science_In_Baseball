# Data_Science_In_Baseball

## Objectives:
1.	Predict the wins by teams in Major League Baseball by using the **Multiple Linear Regression model**
2.	Analyse the career performance of top batters and pitchers based on the average homeruns and strikeouts by the players individually
3.	Explore the relationship between how many runs a team score and the number of the wins they have. **Linear regression** and the **Decision Tree Regression Algorithm**  have been used for analytical modelling.
